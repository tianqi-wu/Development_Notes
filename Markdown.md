# Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows people to write documents in a plain text format that is easy to read and write.

Documents written in Markdown can export documents in HTML, Word, images, PDF, Epub and other formats.

The suffixes of documents written in Markdown are .md, .markdown.

## Markdown title

There are a total of six levels of Markdown titles.

```
# First level heading
## Secondary heading
### Three-level heading
#### Four-level heading
##### Five-level heading
###### Sixth level heading

```

## Markdown paragraph

Markdown paragraphs have no special format; we just need to write the text directly.

Main branch methods:
1) Type two spaces at the end of the line to indicate a new line;

2) A blank line between two lines indicates the beginning of a new paragraph.

## Markdown font

The font of Markdown is as follows:

```
*Italic text*
**Bold text**
***Italic bold text***
_Italic text_
__Bold text__
___Italic bold text___
```

### Markdown Line Split

Use three or more special symbols in a line.

The use of special symbols is as follows:

```
***

* * *

*****

---

----------
```

### Strikethrough

If you want to add a strikethrough to the text in a paragraph, you only need to add  ~~ at both ends of the text.

The use of strikethrough is as follows:

```
~Delete this text~
```

### Underscore


Underscore can be used with:
```
<u>Underlined content</u>
```


### Footnote

The footnote is a supplementary explanation to the article.

The format of the footnote is as follows:

```
[^Text to be noted]
```

The method used is as follows:

```
Create a footnote format like this [^note].

[^Note]: Tutorial - Tutorial! ! !
```

Create a footnote format like this [^note].

[^Note]: Tutorial - Tutorial! ! !


## Markdown list

Markdown supports ordered and non-ordered lists.

Unordered lists are marked with an asterisk, plus or minus sign.

```
* the first item
* second section
* the third item

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item


- the first item
- second section
- the third item
```

The effect is as follows:
* the first item
* second section
* the third item

+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item


- the first item
- second section
- the third item

The ordered list can be used by adding numbers and.

1. The first item
2. The second item
3. The third item

#### List nesting

Just need to be in the sublist

## Markdown block

Block quotes use the> symbol at the beginning of the paragraph, followed by a space symbol.

Source code:

```
> Block Reference
> Novice Tutorial
> Learning is not only technology but also dream
```

> Block Reference
> Novice Tutorial
> Learning is not only technology but also dream
